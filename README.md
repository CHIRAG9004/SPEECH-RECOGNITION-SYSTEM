# Discrption - As part of my internship, I developed a Speech Recognition System that enables voice-based interaction between humans and machines. The goal of the project was to create an intelligent interface that could recognize spoken commands and trigger corresponding actions, making human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive.

The system captures voice input through a microphone and processes it using a speech recognition module or software. Depending on the architecture, the system either uses offline modules like Voice Recognition Module V3 (for Arduino) or software-based libraries such as Google Speech API or Python's SpeechRecognition library (for PC or Raspberry Pi). Recognized commands are then used to control devices, display responses, or perform automated tasks.
